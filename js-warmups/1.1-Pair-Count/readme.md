Imagine you have a group of n people. Implement a function called pairCount which counts the number of ways you can create a pair by selecting two people in the group.

Note that the order of people in the pair doesn't matter: a pair with person A and person B shouldn't be counted as different than a pair with person B and person A.

Examples:

```js
pairCount(1); // 0
pairCount(2); // 1
pairCount(3); // 3
pairCount(4); // 6
pairCount(8); // 28
pairCount(25); // 300
pairCount(120); // 7140
pairCount(999); // 498501
```
