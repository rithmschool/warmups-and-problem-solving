Description

Write a function called averagePair that accepts a sorted array of integers and a target average number. Determine if there is a pair of values in the array whose average equals the target.

There may be more than one pair that matches the average target, but you simply have to return true if there is a match and false otherwise.

Bonus Constraints

Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Examples

```js
averagePair([1, 2, 3], 2.5); // true, because (2 + 3)/2 === 2.5

averagePair([1, 3, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 19], 8); // true

averagePair([-1, 0, 3, 4, 5, 6], 4.1); // false

averagePair([], 4); // false
```
